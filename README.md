mac-ansible
===========

I use this project to configure my macOS the way I like it. That way I can wipe
and re-install with less effort. See my
[blog post](https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/03/20/how-i-provision-my-macbook-with-ansible/).

Getting Started
---------------

1. Setup your laptop to use the repo with `make setup`
2. Run the playbook with `make run`

Fork! Copy! Adapt!
